# ☁️ Cloud Computing

## 🌍 Cloud Models

### 💡 What Is Cloud Computing?
- More than just a remote server — it extends **applications and services globally**.
- Offers **virtually unlimited resources** (you pay for what you use).
- Allows **infrastructure deployment within minutes**.

---

### 🏗️ Cloud Deployment Models

| Model | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Public Cloud** | Available to everyone on the internet. |
| **Private Cloud** | Your own virtualized data center, fully controlled and managed by your organization. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Combination of public and private cloud environments. |
| **Community Cloud** | Shared among multiple organizations with similar goals or requirements. |

---

### 🧱 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Also known as **Hardware as a Service (HaaS)**.
- You **outsource physical infrastructure** (servers, storage, networking) but still manage:
  - Operating systems  
  - Applications  
  - Security and configurations  
- Example: **Web hosting providers**, **AWS EC2**, **Google Compute Engine**.

---

### 🧩 Software as a Service (SaaS)
- **On-demand software** — simply log in and use.
- No need to manage infrastructure, installations, or updates.
- Offers **complete applications** ready to use.
- Examples: **Gmail**, **Salesforce**, **Microsoft 365**, **Dropbox**.

---

### 🧠 Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- No servers, no software maintenance — **the provider manages everything**.
- You focus on **developing and deploying applications**.
- Limited control over data and infrastructure.
- Examples: **Google App Engine**, **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, **Heroku**.

## ⚙️ Cloud Characteristics

### 🔄 Shared Resources

#### Internal / Private Cloud
- All resources are **dedicated for internal use**.
- **Upfront cost** for hardware and setup.
- You **manage and maintain your own** data center.

#### External / Public Cloud
- Resources shared on a **third-party provider’s infrastructure**.
- **Pay-as-you-go** or **subscription-based** cost model.

### 💰 Metered vs. Non-Metered Services

| Type | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Metered** | Pay only for what you use. Includes costs for: <br> • Uploading data (ingress) <br> • Storing data <br> • Downloading data (egress). |
| **Non-Metered** | Flat-rate or block-based payment. No per-usage fees for upload or download. |

---

### 🧩 Key Cloud Characteristics

- **Elasticity** — Scale resources **up or down** dynamically based on demand.  
- **Availability** — High uptime through **redundant systems and failover mechanisms**.  
- **File Synchronization** — Data can be **mirrored across regions**, ensuring consistency and accessibility.  
- **Multitenancy** — Multiple clients can **share the same infrastructure** securely and independently.
