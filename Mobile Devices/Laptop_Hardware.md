# Laptop Hardware Cheatsheet
**Topic:** Laptop Hardware Components & Upgrades  
**Purpose:** Quick reference for laptop repair, upgrades, and hardware-specific notes.

---

## Overview
- Laptops are built to **precise specifications**, making them harder to repair than desktops.  
- Repair processes **vary by manufacturer**.  
- Many components have **smaller form factors** to fit compact designs.  

---

## Laptop Batteries
- Some are **user-replaceable**, others are not.  
- Common types:  
  - **Li-ion (Lithium-Ion)**  
  - **LiPo (Lithium-Polymer)**  
- Battery form factors differ across manufacturers.  

---

## Laptop Keyboards
- **Most used component** on a laptop.  
- Usually replaceable: secured with screws and ribbon cable (complexity varies).  
- **Diagnostics:**  
  - Connect an **external USB keyboard** to determine if issue is with hardware or OS.  
  - External keyboards allow a **workaround** for faulty internal keyboards.  
- Laptop keyboards are **compact** compared to desktops.  

---

## Laptop Keys
- Repairs may involve replacing individual **key caps**.  
- Desktop key caps are sturdy; laptop key caps are **more fragile**.  

---

## Laptop Memory (RAM)
- Uses **smaller form factors** than desktops.  
- **SO-DIMM (Small Outline DIMM):** standard for laptops and mobile devices.  
- Often **easy to install/replace**, but:  
  - Some memory is **soldered to the motherboard** (requires full board replacement).  

---

## Laptop Storage
- **Older models:** Traditional HDD (mechanical, magnetic disks).  
- **Modern models:** SSD (Solid State Drive) – faster, no moving parts.  
- **M.2 SSD:** small form factor, easy to replace, saves space.  

### Replacing Storage
- **HDD/SSD:** Open back cover, remove screws, disconnect drive.  
- **M.2:** Slides into slot and screws into motherboard.  

### Migrating from HDD to SSD
- **Benefits:** Feels like a new laptop; significant performance boost.  
- **Options:**  
  - Install OS fresh, manually move files, reinstall applications.  
  - Use **imaging/cloning software** to duplicate existing data (open-source tools available).  

---

## Wireless & Bluetooth
- Often integrated into **motherboard**.  
- **Mini PCI** cards provide Wi-Fi (802.11 standards).  
- **Bluetooth** usually built-in for PAN (Personal Area Network).  

---

## Wi-Fi Antennas
- Multiple antennas: **wireless (main/aux)** + **Bluetooth**.  
- Wires routed around the **laptop display** for optimal signal.  
- Antennas connect back to motherboard wireless modules.  

---

## Biometrics
- Authentication via **fingerprint or facial recognition**.  
- Security factor: **“something you are.”**  
- Requires compatible OS + biometric hardware.  
- **Windows Hello:**  
  - **Hello Face** (camera)  
  - **Hello Fingerprint** (scanner)  

---

## Near-Field Communication (NFC)
- Common on **phones and smart devices**.  
- Short-range: ~4 cm or less.  
- Uses: **data transfer** and **authentication**.  

---

## Camera / Webcam
- Captures **video and audio**.  
- Suitable for casual use, but **not ideal for professional-grade work**.
