# 🛠 Network Tools Cheat Sheet

## Overview
Network tools help diagnose, analyze, and configure network connections.  
They range from **hardware crimpers** to **software-based analyzers**.

---

### 🔌 Cable Crimpers
- Permanently attach **modular connectors** to wires  
  - Supported types: **Coaxial, Twisted Pair, Fiber**  
- Essential for building or repairing **Ethernet cables**

---

### 📶 WiFi Analyzer
- Hardware or software-based tool to **analyze wireless networks**  
- Can display:  
  - **Frequencies & Channels**  
  - **Signal Strength**  
  - **Access Points & Devices**  
  - **Interference**  
- Can use **spectrum analyzers** for detailed frequency info

---

### 🎵 Tone Generator & Probe
- Generates **analog signals** along a wire  
- Used with a **toner probe** to trace cables and find endpoints  
- Useful for **wire identification** and troubleshooting

---

### 🔨 Punch Down Tool
- **Punches wires** into a wiring block (patch panel or keystone)  
- Tedious but precise: every wire must be individually punched  
- Commonly used in structured cabling installations

---

### 🔍 Cable Tester
- Verifies cable integrity and connectivity  
- Can detect:  
  - **Crossed wires**  
  - **Missed pins**  
  - **Open or shorted connections**  

---

### 🔁 Loopback Plugs
- Tests **physical ports** or interfaces on devices  
- Loops signal back into the port to verify **transmit/receive functionality**  
- Does **not cross over** cables

---

### 🖧 Taps & Port Mirrors
- Used to **intercept network traffic** for monitoring or analysis  
- **Physical Tap:**  
  - Disconnects link and inserts a tap in the middle  
  - Can be **passive** or **active**  
- **Port Mirror:**  
  - Software-based tap  
  - Copies traffic to a **packet capture device**  
  - Non-intrusive to normal traffic flow
