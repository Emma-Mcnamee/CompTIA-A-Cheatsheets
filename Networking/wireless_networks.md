## 🔹 Wireless Network Technologies

### IEEE Standards
- **IEEE** = *Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.*
- The **802.11 committee** defines wireless networking standards.
- To simplify, these standards are also known by **Wi-Fi generations**:
  - **Wi-Fi 4** → 802.11n  
  - **Wi-Fi 5** → 802.11ac  
  - **Wi-Fi 6 / 6E** → 802.11ax  
  - **Wi-Fi 7** → 802.11be  

> ⚙️ Each new generation improves **speed**, **range**, and **efficiency**.

## 🔹 802.11 Technologies

- Wi-Fi networks operate on **different frequency bands**, depending on the standard:
  - **2.4 GHz** → Longer range, slower speeds, more interference.  
  - **5 GHz** → Faster speeds, shorter range, less interference.  
  - **6 GHz** → Used by Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 for high throughput and low latency.  
- Each frequency band is divided into smaller segments called **channels**.  
- Channels are **regulated** by government and regional entities (e.g., FCC in the U.S.).  

> 🧠 **Tip:** More GHz = more frequencies = more bandwidth.  
> Fewer frequencies = more overlap and interference.

## 🔹 Band Selection & Bandwidth

| Band | Frequency | Pros | Cons |
|------|------------|------|------|
| **2.4 GHz** | Longer wavelength | Longer range | More interference |
| **5 GHz** | Shorter wavelength | Faster, less interference | Shorter range |
| **6 GHz** | Very short wavelength | Extremely fast, low latency | Requires modern devices |

> Bandwidth = size of the “data highway.”  
> More bandwidth = more simultaneous data transfers.

## 🔹 Bluetooth

- **Purpose:** Short-range wireless communication (no cables).  
- **Frequency:** Uses **2.4 GHz ISM band** (unlicensed).  
- **Range:** ~10 meters (33 feet).  
- **Usage:** Headphones, keyboards, car systems, etc.  
- **Connection:** Uses a *pairing process*, often with a PIN, to authenticate and remember devices.

> 💡 ISM = *Industrial, Scientific, and Medical* frequencies (free to use without a license).

## 🔹 RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)

- Used in:
  - ID badges  
  - Retail anti-theft tags  
  - Animal tracking chips  
  - Inventory management  
- Works via **radio waves** — reader sends energy to activate the tag.
- The tag transmits its **unique ID** back to the reader.  

> 🎯 Think of RFID as *wireless barcodes* powered by radio waves.

## 🔹 NFC (Near Field Communication)

- **Two-way** wireless communication over very short distances.
