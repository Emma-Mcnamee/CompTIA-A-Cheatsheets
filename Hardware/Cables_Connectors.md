# Cables and Connectors — CompTIA A+

## Network Cables

### Importance of Cable
- Fundamental to network communication.  
- Most wireless networks still rely on cabling infrastructure.  

### Twisted Pair Copper Cabling
- **Balanced pair operation:** two wires with equal and opposite signals twisted together.  
- Wires: Transmit+/Transmit-, Receive+/Receive-.  
- Twists help reduce interference.  

### Cable Categories
- Copper cables themselves don’t have speed; signals determine speed.  
- Must follow IEEE Ethernet standards.  
- Common categories: Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6A.  
- Category printed on the cable jacket.  

### Coaxial Cable
- Two or more conductors sharing a common axis (inner conductor + shield).  
- Commonly used for cable internet and broadband.  

### Shielding
- **UTP:** Unshielded Twisted Pair (most common).  
- **STP:** Shielded Twisted Pair (extra protection from interference).  
- Shielding codes: U=Unshielded, S=Braided Shield, F=Foil Shield.  

### Special Cables
- **Direct Burial STP:** Waterproof, gel-filled for underground use.  
- **Plenum-Rated Cable:** Fire-resistant jackets for air-handling spaces.

## Structured Cabling Standards

### T568A and T568B Colors
- Defined by TIA (Telecommunications Industry Association).  
- Specifies pin assignments for 8P8C (RJ45) connectors.  
- Important for consistency in network cabling.  
- Many organizations use T568B.

## Optical Fiber

### Fiber Communication
- Transmits information as light.  
- Immune to RF interference; slow to degrade.  

### Fiber Types
- **MultiMode Fiber:** Short-range (inside building), LED light sources, up to 200 km.  
- **Single Mode Fiber:** Long-range, laser light sources, up to 100 m.

## Peripheral Cables

### USB (Universal Serial Bus)
- Connects printers, storage, keyboards, mice, etc.  
- Versions: USB 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2 (improvements in speed and distance).  
- Standard A: typical USB plug.  
- Standard B: often for printers.  
- Mini B / Micro B: mobile devices.  

### USB-C
- Universal connector for data, power, and video.  
- Reversible orientation.  

### Serial Cables
- **D-Sub / DB-9 / DB-25**: Legacy RS-232 connections.  

### Thunderbolt
- High-speed serial connector with data and power.  
- Copper: up to 3 meters; optical: up to 60 meters.

## Video Connectors

- **HDMI:** Audio and video; 19-pin Type A.  
- **DisplayPort:** Packetized audio and video; compatible with HDMI/DVI.  
- **DVI:** Older digital video; multiple connector types.  
- **VGA:** Analog video; legacy devices; DB-15 connector.  
- **USB-C:** Multi-use (data, power, Thunderbolt, video).  

---

## Storage Cables

### SATA (Serial ATA)
- Connects internal storage drives.  
- 15-pin (power) + 7-pin (data) cables.  
- **eSATA:** External version; slightly different connector.  

---

## Adapters and Converters
- Convert between connector types or protocols.  
- Can be temporary or permanent.  
- Examples: video adapters, USB hubs, Ethernet converters.  

---

## Copper Connectors

- **RJ11:** 6P2C; telephone/DSL.  
- **RJ45:** 8P8C; Ethernet.  
- **F-Connector:** Coaxial; cable TV / DOCSIS modem.  
- **Punchdown Block:** Wire-to-wire patch panel.  
- **Molex:** 4-pin peripheral power (+12V, +5V).  
- **Lightning:** 8-pin Apple proprietary.  
- **DB-9:** RS-232 legacy devices.

## Fiber Connectors

- **ST (Straight Tip):** Bayonet, stick and twist to lock.  
- **SC (Subscriber Connector):** Square push-in connector.  
- **LC (Lucent Connector):** Small, compact, clip locks in place.
