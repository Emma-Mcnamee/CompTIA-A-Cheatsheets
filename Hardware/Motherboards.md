# 🧠 CompTIA A+ Cheatsheet: Motherboards

## 🧩 Motherboard Form Factors

Different computers require different motherboard sizes and layouts.  
Factors include **physical size, layout, power, and airflow**.

### 📚 Exam Focus
Be prepared to:
- Install & configure **motherboards, CPUs, and add-on cards**
- Choose the **best motherboard** for a scenario (ATX, microATX, ITX)

---

### 🖥️ ATX (Advanced Technology Extended)
- Standard, full-size motherboard format  
- Modern versions use a **24-pin power connector**
- Supports multiple expansion slots & components  
- Great airflow and flexibility  

---

### 🧰 microATX (μATX / M-ATX)
- **Smaller** than ATX  
- Fewer expansion slots but **backward compatible**  
- Uses **similar power** and **mounting points** as ATX  
- Popular, affordable, and compact  

---

### ⚙️ ITX Form Factor
- Low-power motherboards developed in **2001**  
- **Mini-ITX** is screw-compatible with ATX  
- Great for **single-use** or **compact computing builds**

---

## 🔌 Motherboard Expansion Slots

### 🧠 Computer Bus
- The **pathway** connecting motherboard components  
- Enables communication between CPU, memory, and peripherals  
- Increases system **functionality** and **expandability**

---

### 🧩 PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)
- Legacy standard with **32-bit / 64-bit** bus widths  
- Found in older systems  
- **PCI+** (updated version) was more common later  

---

### ⚡ PCI Express (PCIe)
- Replaced older PCI standard  
- Uses **unidirectional serial lanes** for faster communication  
- Slot sizes: **x1, x2, x4, x8, x16, x32** (read as “by one,” “by four,” etc.)  
- **Keyway** is closer to motherboard edge  
- Supports GPUs, NVMe drives, and modern expansion cards  

---

## 🔋 Motherboard Connections

### 🔌 24-Pin Motherboard Power
- Main power connector  
- Supplies **3.3V, 5V, and 12V** power  
- PCI = 20 pins  
- PCIe = 24 pins (can connect interchangeably)  

---

### ⚡ PCIe 6-Pin & 8-Pin Power
- Provides **additional 12V power** to PCIe devices (e.g., GPUs)

---

### 💽 SATA & eSATA Connectors
- **Data connections** for SATA drives (HDDs, SSDs, optical drives)

---

### 🧷 Headers
- **Pin headers** connect devices like:
  - Front panel buttons
  - USB ports
  - LEDs  
- Simple electrical interfaces for modular connections  

---

### 💾 M.2 Connector
- Compact connector for **NVMe** or **SATA SSDs**  
- Enables high-speed storage with minimal space  

---

## 🧮 Motherboard Compatibility

### 🧠 CPU Manufacturers
- **Intel** and **AMD** dominate the market  
- Motherboards are **specific** to CPU type and socket  
- 💸 **AMD = better value**  
- ⚙️ **Intel = stronger performance**

---

### 🖥️ Server Motherboards
- Support **multiple CPU sockets** for parallel processing  
- Include **more memory slots** and **expansion bays**  
- Designed for **19” rack-mounted** systems  
- Ideal for virtualization, databases, and enterprise workloads  

---

✅ **Key Takeaways**
- Match form factor to system purpose (ATX, microATX, ITX)
- Know your CPU socket type (Intel vs. AMD)
- PCIe replaced PCI – remember lane counts (x1, x4, x8, x16)
- Power connectors: 24-pin main, 6/8-pin for GPUs
- M.2 = fastest internal storage interface today
