## Display Types

### LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
- Uses literal liquid crystals that light shines through.  
- Lightweight, low power, inexpensive.  
- Black levels are a challenge; requires separate backlight, which can be hard to replace.

#### LCD Technologies
- **TN (Twisted Nematic):** Fast response times but poor viewing angles.  
- **IPS (In-Plane Switching):** Great color representation, more expensive.  
- **VA (Vertical Alignment):** Good color, slower response times.  

### OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)
- No backlight; organic compounds emit light when receiving electricity.  
- Thinner and lighter; commonly found in mobile phones and small devices.  
- More expensive than LCD.  

### Mini LED
- Same backlight tech as conventional LED but with smaller LEDs.  
- Each LED can be enabled/disabled for better color intensity control.  
- Improved dark screen performance.  

### Touchscreen
- Combines laptop and tablet input.  

### Digitizer
- Pen-like device for graphical input.  

### Backlight & Inverter
- LCD displays require a backlight (fluorescent or LED).  
- Some laptops have inverters to convert DC to AC for the backlight.

## Display Attributes

### Pixel Density
- Measures pixels per inch (PPI).  
- Higher density = sharper, clearer images.  
- Consider how the display will be viewed or printed.  

### Refresh Rates
- Series of images shown consecutively in frames.  
- **Hertz (Hz):** Number of cycles per second.  
- **FPS (Frames Per Second):** Number of frames displayed per second.  
- Higher refresh rates = better for fast-moving content.  

### Screen Resolution
- Number of pixels: width × height.  
- More pixels = more detailed display output.  

### Color Gamut
- Range of colors that can be displayed or seen.  
- Consider intended use when choosing a display.  

### Color Coverage
- Compare display coverage against standards like sRGB (e.g., 80% sRGB).  
- OLED displays generally offer wider color gamut.
