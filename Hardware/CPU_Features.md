# 🧠 CPU Features

## ⚙️ Operating System Technology

### 32-bit vs 64-bit
- **Processor-specific** — determines how much information can be processed at once  
- **32-bit processors**: support up to **4GB of RAM**  
- **64-bit processors**: support up to **17 billion GB of RAM**  
- Operating systems have their own **maximum supported value**  
- **Hardware drivers** must match OS version (32-bit or 64-bit)  
- **Applications** are also built for either 32-bit or 64-bit systems

## 🧩 Advanced RISC Machine (ARM)
- A **CPU architecture** that defines chip design, licensing, and building  
- Known for being **efficient and fast**  
- Commonly used in **mobile devices** and **IoT hardware**

## 🧮 Processor Cores
- CPUs are often identified by the **number of cores**  
- **Each core** has its own **cache memory**  
- More cores = **greater multitasking and efficiency**
