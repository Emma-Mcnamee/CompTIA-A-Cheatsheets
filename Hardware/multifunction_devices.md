## 📦 Unboxing and Setup

- These devices can be **large** — ensure there’s enough **space**.
- Place in an area that’s **accessible** and has **network access**.
- Check for **power and cable reach** before installation.

## ⚙️ Printer Drivers

Drivers are **model-specific** and **must match exactly**.

- Download the **correct driver** for your printer model.
- Match your **operating system**:
  - Windows, macOS, Linux
  - 32-bit vs 64-bit OS
- **Never mix or mismatch** drivers — it causes errors.

### 🖨️ PCL vs PostScript

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **PCL (Printer Command Language)** | Common printer language, faster, efficient | General use |
| **PostScript** | High-end printing, uses language to render images/text on page | Graphic design, publishing |

> ✅ **Tip:** Use the driver that matches your printer’s language (PCL or PostScript).

## 💾 Firmware

Firmware = the **printer’s built-in operating system**.

- Controls startup, networking, and print processes.
- Manufacturers release updates for:
  - **Bug fixes**
  - **Performance improvements**
  - **New features**
- Updates are usually available on the **manufacturer’s website**.

> ⚠️ Always update firmware carefully — losing power mid-update can brick the device.

## 🔌 Wired Device Sharing

### Common Connection Types
- **USB:** Easiest for local use; different devices use different USB standards.
- **Ethernet (RJ45):** Common for network printers.

### Wireless Connection Options
- **Bluetooth:** Short range, limited bandwidth.
- **802.11 Infrastructure Mode:** Uses a central access point — most common.
- **802.11 Ad Hoc Mode:** Direct device-to-device, no access point.

## 🖥️ Printer Sharing

### 1. Local Printer Sharing
- Printer is connected to a **computer**.
- That computer shares the printer with others.
- **Drawback:** Host computer must be powered on.

### 2. Network (Server) Printing
- **Print servers** handle all job requests.
- Jobs are **queued** and **managed directly** on the printer.
- Preferred in **business environments**.
