# 🌬️ Cooling Systems

## 💻 Case Fans
- Pull **cool air** through the computer to keep internal components from overheating  
- **Airflow design** and **component placement** are key for effective cooling  
- Available in many case types and configurations  

---

## 🎮 On-Board Fans
- Built directly into **adapter cards** (e.g., high-end GPUs or video cards)  
- Designed to **cool the entire card**  
- Can be **large or bulky** depending on performance needs  

---

## ⚙️ Fan Specifications
- Common fan sizes: **80mm, 120mm, 200mm**, etc.  
- Variations in:
  - **Speed (RPM)**
  - **Noise level (dBA)**
  - **Airflow capacity (CFM)**  

---

## 🔇 Fanless / Passive Cooling
- Used when **quiet operation** is essential  
- Relies on **heat dissipation** through materials instead of fans  
- Common in **low-power components** or **specialized thermal designs**  
- Requires **precise thermal testing** and careful heat management  

---

## 🔥 Heat Sinks
- **Dissipate heat** using **thermal conduction**  
- Typically made from **copper** or **aluminum alloy**  
- **Fins or grids** increase surface area to transfer heat to cooler air  
- Often paired with fans for active cooling  

---

## 🧴 Thermal Paste
- A **conductive grease** that fills microscopic gaps between the **heat sink** and **component**  
- Ensures **maximum heat transfer efficiency**  

---

## 🧊 Thermal Pad
- A **pre-formed pad** placed on top of a hot component  
- The **heat sink** is mounted over it for stable and clean heat transfer  
- Easier to apply than paste but slightly less effective  

---

## 💧 Liquid Cooling
- Uses **coolant circulation** for heat removal  
- **Quieter** and more **efficient** than air cooling  
- Ideal for:
  - **High-performance systems**
  - **Servers**
  - **Gaming PCs**
