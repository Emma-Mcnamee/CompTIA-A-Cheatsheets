# Troubleshooting Mobile Devices

## Poor Battery Health
- **Replace aging batteries** — performance and capacity degrade over time.  
- **Bad reception** causes the phone to constantly search for signal → rapid battery drain.  
  - Use **Airplane Mode** in poor coverage areas to conserve power.  
- **Disable unnecessary features** (Bluetooth, location services, background refresh).  
- Check **battery usage by app** to identify high-drain applications.  

---

## Swollen Battery
- Caused by **gas buildup** inside the cell.  
- Batteries are **sealed units** — **never puncture or open** a swollen pack.  
- **Turn off and replace immediately** — can damage device or cause fire.  
- Do **not charge** or use the device until the battery is replaced.  

---

## Broken Screen
- **Backup data immediately** before repair.  
- The **entire display assembly** (LCD + glass) must be replaced — no easy fix.  
- Use **clear tape** over cracked glass to prevent injury until repair.  
- Handle shards carefully — broken screens are sharp.  

---

## Improper Charging
- Check **every component** in the charging chain:
  - Cable connection (clean out dust or debris).  
  - Cable condition (replace if frayed or damaged).  
  - Try a **known-good cable and adapter** to isolate issue.  
  - Test **wall outlet** with multimeter.  
- If all external components are fine, issue may be with the **device’s charging port or circuitry**.  

---

## Poor or No Connectivity
- **Signal strength** depends on location and obstructions.  
- **Wi-Fi range** is limited — walls and interference reduce speed and reliability.  
- Try **different channels or frequencies** (2.4 GHz vs 5 GHz) to improve performance.  

---

## Liquid Damage
- Many phones include a **Liquid Contact Indicator (LCI)** near charging or SIM ports.  
  - Changes color when exposed to moisture.  
- If wet:
  - **Power off immediately.**  
  - Remove case, SIM, cards, and (if possible) the battery.  
  - Let device **air-dry naturally** — **do not** use heat or rice.  
  - Wait at least **24 hours** before powering back on.  

---

## Overheating
- Devices automatically **shut down** to prevent permanent heat damage.  
- Common causes:  
  - Heavy **CPU or battery usage**, bright display, or charging while in use.  
- Mitigation:
  - Review **running apps** for high CPU use.  
  - Avoid **direct sunlight** or hot surfaces.  
  - Remove case during charging to allow heat dissipation.  

---

## Digitizer Issues
- Touchscreen unresponsive or black.  
- Try a **forced restart**:
  - **iOS:** perform a hard reset.  
  - **Android:** hold Power + Volume Down.  
- If issue persists, may be **digitizer hardware failure.**  

---

## Physically Damaged Port
- Charging or data port fails to function.  
- Usually requires **system board replacement.**  
- Avoid forcing cables or inserting debris.  

---

## Malware
- Mobile devices are vulnerable to **malicious apps and downloads.**  
- Symptoms:  
  - Unusual apps appearing.  
  - High CPU or data usage.  
  - Frequent pop-ups or crashes.  
- Mitigation:
  - Run a **mobile security scanner.**  
  - Remove suspicious apps.  
  - Keep OS and apps updated.  

---

## Cursor Drift / Ghost Touch
- Screen registers random touches or movements.  
- Use a **touch calibration app** to retrain sensitivity.  
- Ensure screen is **clean and free of moisture.**  

---

## Unable to Install New Apps
- **Check available storage.**  
- Verify **network connectivity.**  
- Ensure the **app is compatible** with device and OS version.  
- Try **logging out and back in** to the app store.  
- Restart the device if issue persists.  

---

## Stylus Does Not Work
- Check **power or charge** level of stylus.  
- Ensure **Bluetooth connection** is active and paired.  
- Inspect for **physical damage** or worn tip — replace if needed.  
- Try resetting both the **device and stylus.**  

---

## Degraded Performance
- **Outdated OS or apps** → update and restart.  
- **Low storage** can cause lag and crashes — clear unnecessary files.  
- **Hardware issues** (bad RAM or failing storage) may be the culprit.  
- Check for **background apps** using excessive CPU.  
- If performance remains poor, consider **hardware replacement or upgrade.**
