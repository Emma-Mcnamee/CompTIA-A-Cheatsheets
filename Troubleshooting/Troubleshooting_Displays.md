# Troubleshooting Displays

## Incorrect Input Source
- Verify monitor connection (video and power).
- Check **input selection** on the monitor configuration.
  - If multiple input interfaces are supported, the monitor may auto-detect, but manual configuration may be needed.
- If the **image is dim**, adjust **brightness controls.**
- Swap with a **known good monitor** or connect the monitor to another computer to isolate the issue.
- If **no video appears after Windows loads**, try **VGA mode (F8)**.

---

## LCD Projector Bulbs
- Projector bulbs operate around **1000°C** — extremely bright and hot.
- **Cooling systems** (fans and temperature sensors) are critical to prevent damage.
- Replace **burnt-out bulbs.**
- **Clean air filters** and ensure air intake/exhaust paths are clear.

---

## Fuzzy Image
- LCD displays have a **fixed number of pixels** (native resolution).
- For best results, set **video output resolution = display’s native resolution.**
- If changing resolution, try using **a multiple of the native resolution** to reduce distortion.

---

## Burn-In / Image Persistence
- Occurs across **all monitor types.**
- Some modern displays use **pixel shifting** to prevent burn-in.
- LCDs can experience **image sticking**, which may be reduced by displaying a **white screen overnight**.

---

## Dead Pixels
- **Always black pixels** typically indicate hardware failure.
- Clean the screen to confirm it’s not debris.
- If confirmed dead, **replace the display.**

---

## Flashing Screen
- **Check video and cable connections** — loose connections cause signal loss.
- Try a **different cable** or **monitor** to isolate the issue.
- Verify **video configuration** matches the monitor’s specifications (resolution, refresh rate).

---

## Incorrect Color Display
- **Colors inaccurate or tinted?**
  - Reset monitor color settings to **factory defaults.**
  - Check for **driver-level color profiles** or **OS color filters** (Night Light, True Tone, etc.).
  - Ensure no **software tint settings** are active.

---

## Audio Issues (Monitors with Built-in Speakers)
- Check:
  - **Volume controls** (both on the monitor and in OS settings).
  - **Audio input connection** — HDMI/DisplayPort carries both video and audio, but configuration matters.
  - **Default playback device** in the OS — confirm the correct output is selected.

---

## Dim Image
- Check **video and brightness settings.**
- Review **OS power and battery settings** — laptops may dim on battery power.
- Inspect **driver settings** for adaptive brightness or dimming.
- **Backlight failure** may cause partial dimming or dark sections.
  - May be repairable, but often requires **display replacement.**

---

## Image Quality Issues
- Inspect **cable pins** for bends or damage.
- Match **refresh rate and resolution** in OS settings to the display’s **native specs.**
- Try a **different cable** or **port.**
- Disable **hardware acceleration** (test for driver or GPU rendering issues).

---

## Sizing Issues
- **Scaling mismatch** between video output and screen.
- Adjust **scaling settings** in OS or monitor menu.
- For high-resolution displays, use **native resolution** and **OS scaling** to maintain clarity.

---

## Distorted Image
- **Flickering, flashing, or warped visuals:**
  - Possible **hardware failure** — LCD panels are fragile and may need replacement.
  - Could also be **bad cables** or **faulty adapters.**
  - If hardware checks out, **update or reinstall video drivers.**
