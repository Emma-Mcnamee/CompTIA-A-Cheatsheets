# Printer Maintenance

## 🖨️ Laser Printers

Laser printers combine **lasers, high voltage, charged ions, powdered ink, heat, and paper**.  
They’re **fast, high-quality, and complex** machines.

### 🔄 Replacing Toner Cartridges
- Watch for low toner messages — **“Low” doesn’t mean empty**.
- Toner may include the **Organic Photoconductor (OPC) drum**.
  - The OPC drum is **sensitive to light** — keep it in its bag until installation.

---

### 🧰 Laser Printer Maintenance Kit
- Laser printers wear out due to **moving parts, heat, and pressure**.
- A standard maintenance kit includes tools and replacement parts.
- Use the **printer’s page counter** to know when maintenance is due.

---

### ⚙️ Laser Printer Calibration
- Different toner cartridges print at different **densities**.
- Use the **calibration option** to adjust print density for consistency.

---

### 🧼 Laser Printer Cleaning
- Toner is **fine dust**, making these printers dirty over time.
- Follow manufacturer cleaning recommendations.
- Always use **cold water** (toner melts with heat).
- **Isopropyl alcohol** is a safe cleaning option.

## 🖋️ Inkjet Printers

Inkjet (ink-dispersion) printers are **inexpensive, quiet, and high-resolution**.  
However, ink is **expensive**, **fades over time**, and **clogs easily**.

---

### 🧩 Ink Cartridge
- Ink is sprayed onto paper from a set of cartridges (usually **CMYK: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black**).

---

### 🖨️ Print Head
- Some printers integrate the **print head into the ink cartridge** itself.

---

### 📄 Feed Rollers
- Pull paper through the printer.
- Must be **clean** and **not worn**.
- Support **duplexing** (printing on both sides).

---

### 🧰 Inkjet Printer Maintenance

#### Cleaning Print Heads
- Print heads have **tiny holes** that clog easily.
- Many printers **auto-clean daily**.
- Signs of clogging: **streaks or missing sections** in prints.

#### Replacing Inkjet Cartridges
- Colors may be **separate** (CMYK) or **combined**.
- Simply pop out the old one and insert the new.
- Printer will **auto-calibrate** after installation.

#### Calibration
- Align nozzles to paper — lines should be **crisp** and colors **aligned**.
- Use the **built-in calibration option**.

#### Clearing Jams
- Remove tray and loose paper.
- Pull paper from feed path **firmly but carefully** — don’t tear it.

## ♨️ Thermal Printers

Thermal printers use **chemically treated paper** that turns **black when heated**.  
Common in **receipts and label printers**.  
They’re **quiet**, simple, and **don’t use ink**.

---

### 🧱 Components
- **Feed Assembly:** Pulls paper through a small path.
- **Heating Element:** Fixed in place, heats the full paper width.
- **Thermal Paper:** Special paper that changes color when heated.

---

### 🧰 Thermal Printer Maintenance

#### Replacing Thermal Paper
- Use **only thermal paper** (specific to model/size).
- Not interchangeable with regular paper.

#### Cleaning the Heating Element
- Use **isopropyl alcohol** or approved cleaning pens.
- Follow manufacturer guidelines.

#### Removing Debris
- Remove bits of paper or dust with a **damp cloth**.
- Avoid excessive moisture.

#### Paper Sensitivity to Heat
- More heat darkens the entire page.
- Receipts **fade over time** — avoid storing near **heat sources** (e.g., dashboards, radiators).

## 💥 Impact Printers (Dot Matrix)

Impact printers use **pins that strike a ribbon** to mark paper.  
Ideal for **carbon copies or multipart forms**.  
They’re **noisy** but have a **low cost per page**.

---

### 🧩 Key Components
- **Print Head:** Matrix of pins that move across paper, striking the ribbon.
- **Printer Ribbon:** Continuous fabric loop — easy to replace.
- **Tractor Feed:** Continuous paper feed with **holes on the sides**.
- **Multipart Paper:** Carbonless copying; multiple forms printed in one pass.

---

### 🧰 Impact Printer Maintenance

#### Replacing Printer Ribbon
- Single continuous loop — replace when print becomes faint.
- Modular design allows replacement in under a minute.

#### Print Head Replacement
- Takes direct impact and heat — replace as needed.
- Also modular (lever or latch release).
- Replace ribbon at the same time for best results.

#### Replacing Paper
- Ensure paper fits **exactly** into tractor feed holes for proper alignment.
